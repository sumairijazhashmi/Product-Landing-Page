# Product Landing Page
I created a Product Landing page website as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. This project is the fourth of five projects required to complete the certification. In this project, I had to build a website that was functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks/
